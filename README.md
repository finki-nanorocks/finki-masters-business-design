# Business Design

Welcome to my Business Design repository, where I've practically realized concepts learned in my master's degree lecture on business design. This repository is instrumental in helping me to complete my final exam.

## Overview

Contained within this repository are the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document and a realized Figma design. You can access the design [here](https://shorturl.nankov.mk/fb22dc7731c74ee0914ca732182e6b04).

## Triathlon

### Introduction

Triathlon emerges from the pressing need within the banking sector to streamline employee onboarding, training, and continuous education regarding internal systems and processes. Traditional training methods often fall short in meeting the dynamic learning needs of banking professionals.

### Inspiration

My inspiration for developing Triathlon stems from witnessing the persistent challenges faced by banks in disseminating knowledge effectively across their workforce. Conventional training methods struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving banking landscape, resulting in notable gaps in employee knowledge and skillsets. With Triathlon, I aim to revolutionize learning within the banking sector by providing a comprehensive, scalable, and customizable solution.

### Research

My development process for Triathlon was rooted in extensive research into the learning and development needs of banking professionals. Through surveys, interviews, and consultations with industry experts, I identified key pain points and requirements. These insights were pivotal in shaping Triathlon's features and functionalities to ensure alignment with the specific needs of banking organizations.

### Defined Process

The development process of Triathlon followed a meticulously defined approach:

1. **Requirement Gathering**: I established a thorough understanding of the learning needs and challenges within the banking sector through stakeholder consultations and market research.

2. **Conceptualization**: Based on the gathered requirements and research insights, I devised a conceptual framework outlining Triathlon's key objectives, target audience, and core features.

3. **Prototyping**: Utilizing rapid prototyping techniques, I translated the conceptual framework into tangible user interface designs and interactive mockups, allowing for early feedback and refinement.

4. **Development**: Triathlon's development followed an agile methodology, facilitating incremental improvements and frequent iterations based on user feedback. Cross-functional teams collaborated closely to ensure timely feature delivery while maintaining quality standards.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Rigorous testing procedures, including functional testing, usability testing, and beta testing, were conducted to identify and rectify any issues. User feedback was continuously integrated to enhance usability and effectiveness.

6. **Deployment and Training**: Upon successful testing, Triathlon was deployed to target banking organizations. Comprehensive training sessions were conducted to familiarize users with Triathlon's functionalities and best practices.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: A feedback mechanism was established post-deployment to gather ongoing insights from users and administrators, guiding subsequent iterations and updates to keep Triathlon relevant and aligned with evolving learning needs.

### Conclusion

Triathlon is the culmination of my extensive research, thoughtful design, and iterative development efforts aimed at addressing the unique learning challenges faced by the banking sector. By providing a scalable, customizable, and intuitive learning solution, Triathlon empowers banking professionals to stay ahead, enhance their skills, and drive organizational success.
